I have attached an installation guide for Ruby on Rails in the appendix of my report. 

Upon completion of this, you can follow these simple steps to launch my website. 

1. Use the cd command in your terminal to navigate into the directory which you have checked out from GitHub. 

2. Type the command “rails s” to start the server on a local host. 

3. You may be prompted to install all of the gems on your machine in which case you can run 'bundle install' to install the missing gems. 

4. Launch a new browser window and search for “localhost:3000”

5. You will now be able to use the website

6. You can create a new account and use the website!
